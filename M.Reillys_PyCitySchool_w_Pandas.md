## Overview of the school district analysis

Maria and her supervisor from Thomas High School reached out to our team after the csv file used with compiled information on student grades was flagged by the school board as potentially revealing evidence of academic dishonsty in the 9th grade reading and math scores. So, in order to maintain the overall integrity of the data, we have been asked per Maria to first replace all values in question with a marker denonted for undefined values (or "NaN") as we work to replace the values. In other words, we removed the questionable 9th grade scores without needing to comprimise/edit/manipulate the rest of the data feild. 

We will rerun the the analysis done prior without counting the 9th grade and associated values. Afterwards, we will work on recalculating said values. With the new values, we will reevaluate overall comparative percentages and analysis. 

Here, you will find the process detailed in this reported. The csv file referenced is attached in this repository as is the code that we run through the file. 



## Results
#### How is the district summary affected?
<!-- Stripping the data of the 9th graders in Thomas High School did not skewed the data heavily and most of the other results of other 9th graders and of Thomas High school remain along similar parameters as others schools. -->
<!-- The mean was the most significant change in our data, as we decrease the count of scores and students of Thomas High School might have had a significant change. Nonetheless having examing the data this might not have as big of an impact as one might have had thought. -->

#### How is the school summary affected?


####  How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#### Math and reading scores by grade
